Many people do not drink enough water, not because they do not care, but because the day moves fast. Hydration works best when it becomes automatic, tied to cues you already follow. This guide shows three simple triggers and a realistic plan to help you drink consistently without feeling forced.

## Simple Cues
### 1) One glass right after waking
Your body loses water overnight. Starting with one glass sets a baseline and makes the rest of the day easier.

### 2) Pair water with meals and snacks
Attach water to actions you already do. Every meal becomes a reminder.

### 3) Keep a bottle within arm’s reach
Out of sight often means out of mind. Visible water means you sip more often.

## Why It Helps
- Supports mental clarity and steady energy  
- Helps regulate appetite and digestion  
- Reduces afternoon fatigue and headaches  

## How Much Is Enough?
There is no perfect number for everyone. A practical rule is to check urine color: pale yellow usually means you are hydrated. If it is dark, add more water.

## 7-Day Plan
**Days 1–2:** Only do the morning glass  
**Days 3–4:** Add water with lunch  
**Days 5–7:** Add water with dinner + keep a bottle nearby  

## Common Mistakes
- Drinking a lot at once and then forgetting for hours  
- Overdoing caffeine without extra water  
- Waiting until you feel thirsty  

## Quick Tip
Add lemon, mint, or cucumber for a lighter taste you will enjoy.
