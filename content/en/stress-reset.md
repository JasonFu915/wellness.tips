When stress builds up, the body shifts into a “fight or flight” state. You can interrupt that cycle in a few minutes without special tools. This short reset helps you return to calm and clarity so you can keep going without burning out.

## The 3-Step Reset
### 1) Lengthen your exhale
Inhale for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds. Do this for 1 minute. Longer exhales signal safety to the brain.

### 2) Release tension in the shoulders
Lift your shoulders toward your ears, hold for 2 seconds, then drop. Repeat 5 times. This tells your body to stop bracing.

### 3) Orient to the room
Look around and name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear. This shifts attention away from spiraling thoughts.

## Why It Works
- Slower breathing reduces stress hormones  
- Muscle release lowers physical tension  
- Sensory focus calms the mind  

## When to Use It
Use this reset:

- Before a meeting  
- After an argument  
- During afternoon fatigue  

## 7-Day Plan
Practice once a day so it becomes automatic. The more familiar it feels, the faster your body responds.

## Quick Tip
Set a daily reminder at the same time, like 3:00 PM, to build the habit.

## When It Works Best
- Before a high-stakes conversation  
- After reading stressful messages  
- During afternoon mental fatigue  

## A 5-Minute Version
1. Continue 4–6 breathing for 2 minutes  
2. Add a gentle neck and shoulder stretch  
3. Write down the next single action you will take
