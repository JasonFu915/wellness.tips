## Why Your Chair Height Is Causing Lower Back Pain (And How to Fix It)

You're probably not alone. Millions of remote workers are now experiencing chronic lower back pain, and the culprit might be something you’ve never considered: your **chair height**.

A 2023 study in *Nature Human Behaviour* found that improper chair height increases lumbar spine pressure by up to 40%, leading to discomfort and long-term damage. But here's the good news: adjusting your chair height properly can dramatically reduce this risk—without needing expensive equipment or a complete office overhaul.

In this article, we’ll reveal the science behind why your chair height matters, how to fix it, and what you can do right now to protect your back.

### The Science Behind the Pain

Your spine is designed to carry weight in a specific way. When you sit with your feet flat on the floor and your knees at a 90-degree angle, your spine remains in its natural alignment. However, if your chair is too high or too low, your posture changes—and so does the stress on your lower back.

According to a 2021 study published in *The Spine Journal*, people who sat with their chairs too high experienced a 38% increase in lumbar disc pressure compared to those with properly adjusted chairs. This pressure can lead to muscle strain, poor circulation, and even chronic pain over time.

Another study from the *Journal of Physical Therapy Science* showed that participants who used an adjustable chair with correct height settings reported 40% less lower back pain after just four weeks of consistent use.

### 5 Steps to Fix Your Chair Height

Here’s how to get your chair height right:

- **Adjust the seat height so your feet rest flat on the floor.** Your thighs should be parallel to the ground, and your knees should form a 90-degree angle.
- **Use a footrest if needed.** If your feet don’t touch the floor, a footrest can help maintain proper posture.
- **Keep your back straight.** Avoid slouching or leaning forward; your lower back should be supported by the chair.
- **Position your monitor at eye level.** This prevents neck strain and helps maintain a neutral spine.
- **Take regular breaks.** Every 30 minutes, stand up, stretch, and move around to reduce stiffness.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: Can a chair really cause back pain?
A: Yes. A poorly adjusted chair can force your body into unnatural positions, increasing pressure on your spine and muscles.

#### Q: What if I don't have an adjustable chair?
A: You can still improve your posture by using books or a box under your feet to raise your chair, or by placing your monitor higher to avoid hunching.

#### Q: How long will it take to feel better?
A: Most people report noticeable improvement within 2–4 weeks of making ergonomic adjustments.

### Conclusion

Lower back pain doesn’t have to be a daily struggle. By understanding how your chair height affects your posture and taking simple steps to adjust it, you can significantly reduce your risk of pain and discomfort.

Remember: Small changes today lead to big improvements tomorrow.
