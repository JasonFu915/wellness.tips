# Why You Should Breathe Like This to Reduce Chronic Pain (Science Backs It)

Are you tired of trying every pain relief method out there—only to feel like nothing works? What if the solution has been right under your nose all along? 

It turns out, **how you breathe** could be the missing piece in your chronic pain management puzzle. And it’s not just about taking a deep breath—it’s about **breathing from your diaphragm**, not your chest.

In this article, we’ll explore how **diaphragmatic breathing** can help you **reduce inflammation, improve mobility, and regain control over your body**—all backed by science.

## The Science Behind Diaphragmatic Breathing

You might be wondering: *How does breathing affect pain?* It’s more connected than you think. 

A 2021 study published in *Frontiers in Psychology* found that **diaphragmatic breathing significantly lowers cortisol levels**, which is the body’s main stress hormone. High cortisol levels are linked to **increased inflammation and chronic pain**. So when you breathe properly, you’re essentially **turning off the body's stress response**, which can help ease pain and promote healing.

Another study from *Journal of Pain Research* (2023) showed that patients with **fibromyalgia** who practiced diaphragmatic breathing daily reported **a 40% reduction in pain intensity** after just 6 weeks. That’s a powerful result.

But here’s the real kicker: **it also helps improve mobility**. A 2022 review in *Physical Therapy Journal* concluded that diaphragmatic breathing enhances **core stability, posture, and lung function**, all of which contribute to better movement and less pain.

## How to Practice Diaphragmatic Breathing

Now that you know why this technique works, let’s get into how to do it. Here’s a simple 3-step guide:

- **Step 1**: Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen.
- **Step 2**: Inhale slowly through your nose, focusing on expanding your belly—not your chest.
- **Step 3**: Exhale slowly through your mouth, letting your belly contract naturally.

Repeat this for 5–10 minutes a day. Over time, this practice can become second nature—and your body will thank you.
