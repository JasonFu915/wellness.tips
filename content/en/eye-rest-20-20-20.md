If your eyes feel tired after a long day at the computer, you are not alone. The 20-20-20 rule is a quick habit that reduces strain and keeps your focus sharp.

## The Rule
Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

## Why It Works
Screen focus keeps your eye muscles locked in one position. Shifting to a far distance relaxes those muscles and reduces fatigue.

## Make It Easy
- Set a recurring reminder  
- Tie it to a routine (after each email batch)  
- Combine with a blink reset (10 slow blinks)  

## Bonus Tips
- Lower screen brightness at night  
- Increase text size to reduce squinting  
- Use artificial tears if your eyes feel dry  

## Quick Tip
Put a small note on your monitor that says “20-20-20” until it becomes automatic.

## Common Questions
**Q: What if 20 feet is too far?**  
A: Any far distance works. The goal is to change focus away from the screen.

**Q: I forget to do it. What helps?**  
A: Tie it to a routine like finishing an email batch or use a timer.

## Extra Eye Care
- Increase text size at night  
- Keep a small bottle of artificial tears if needed  
- Blink slowly for 10 seconds every hour
