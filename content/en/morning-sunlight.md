Morning light is one of the most powerful tools to set your body clock. It tells your brain “daytime has started,” which increases alertness now and improves sleep later at night. You do not need a perfect routine—just consistent exposure.

## Why Morning Light Works
Light reaching your eyes early in the day resets the circadian rhythm. This leads to:

- Better morning energy  
- Improved mood and focus  
- Earlier melatonin release at night  

## The Simple 10-Minute Routine
### 1) Go outside within 60 minutes of waking
Step onto a balcony, take a short walk, or stand by a bright window. Outdoor light is much stronger than indoor light.

### 2) Keep it natural
No sunglasses if possible, and do not look directly at the sun. Just let daylight hit your eyes.

### 3) Combine with a light movement
Walk, stretch, or water your plants to make it feel easy.

## Cloudy Day? Still Counts
Even cloudy daylight is far brighter than indoor lighting. If it is very dark, extend to 15–20 minutes.

## Common Mistakes
- Waiting until late morning  
- Relying only on indoor light  
- Doing it once but not repeating  

## 7-Day Plan
**Days 1–2:** Go outside for 5 minutes  
**Days 3–4:** Increase to 10 minutes  
**Days 5–7:** Pair with a short walk  

## Quick Tip
If mornings are busy, schedule it after brushing your teeth so it becomes automatic.

## Common Questions
**Q: Can I do this by a window?**  
A: It helps, but outdoor light is stronger. If indoors, sit close to the window and extend the time.

**Q: What if it is dark in winter?**  
A: Increase to 15–20 minutes and aim for earlier daylight hours when possible.

## Mistakes to Avoid
- Waiting until late morning  
- Wearing sunglasses when light is low  
- Doing it once and forgetting
