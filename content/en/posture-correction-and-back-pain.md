### The Hidden Cause of Your Back Pain
You might think your back pain is due to age or genetics, but a growing body of research suggests that poor posture plays a major role.

#### The Science Behind Spinal Alignment
A 2022 study in *The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy* found that individuals with slouched postures experienced more frequent and severe lower back pain than those who maintained an upright position. This is because poor posture strains the muscles and ligaments around your spine, leading to long-term discomfort.

Another study from the *Mayo Clinic* showed that even small adjustments in sitting and standing positions can significantly reduce spinal pressure and pain over time.

#### Take Immediate Action
Here are 3 science-backed steps you can take today:

- **Adjust your workspace**: Use an ergonomic chair and keep your screen at eye level to avoid hunching forward.
- **Practice the 'wall test'**: Stand with your back against a wall and try to fit your hand between your lower back and the wall. If it’s too tight, you’re likely slouching.
- **Strengthen your core**: A strong core supports your spine. Try planks or yoga for 10 minutes daily.

> **No time?** Try this 60-second version: Sit up straight, engage your core, and take a deep breath. Do this every hour.

#### Surprising Insight
Did you know that even minor posture improvements can boost your mood and energy levels? A 2021 study in *Frontiers in Psychology* found that people who sat upright reported feeling more confident and alert than those who slouched.

Small changes add up. Start today—your back will thank you.
