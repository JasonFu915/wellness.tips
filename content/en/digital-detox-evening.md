Screens keep the brain alert. If you scroll right up until bedtime, your body stays wired. A short digital detox does not require strict rules—just clear boundaries.

## The 30-Minute Rule
Stop scrolling 30 minutes before bed. Use that time for low-stimulation activities.

## A Simple Replacement Routine
- Put the phone to charge outside the bedroom  
- Prepare clothes or to-do list for tomorrow  
- Read or stretch for 10–15 minutes  

## Why It Works
Less light and less stimulation helps melatonin rise and lowers mental noise.

## 7-Day Plan
**Days 1–2:** Put phone away 10 minutes before bed  
**Days 3–4:** Increase to 20 minutes  
**Days 5–7:** Reach 30 minutes  

## Quick Tip
Use “Do Not Disturb” or Focus mode to remove late-night notifications.

## Common Mistakes
- Swapping social media for work email  
- Waiting until you feel sleepy to start  
- Keeping the phone within reach  

## Why It Works
Lower stimulation helps your brain shift into sleep mode and reduces late-night rumination.

## 7-Day Plan
**Days 1–2:** Put the phone away 10 minutes early  
**Days 3–4:** Increase to 20 minutes  
**Days 5–7:** Reach 30 minutes
