A good breakfast does not need to be complicated. The goal is stable energy without a crash. The simplest formula is protein + fiber + healthy fat.

## The 3-Part Formula
### 1) Protein
Examples: eggs, yogurt, tofu, beans. Protein keeps you full longer.

### 2) Fiber
Examples: oats, berries, whole grains, chia. Fiber slows digestion and stabilizes blood sugar.

### 3) Healthy Fat
Examples: nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil. Fat adds satisfaction and supports hormones.

## Easy Combinations
- Greek yogurt + berries + walnuts  
- Oatmeal + chia + peanut butter  
- Eggs + whole-grain toast + avocado  

## Common Mistakes
- Only carbs (quick energy, fast crash)  
- Sugary drinks without food  
- Skipping breakfast and overeating later  

## 7-Day Plan
Pick one go-to breakfast and repeat it for a week. Make it easy before you make it fancy.

## Quick Tip
Prep ingredients the night before to reduce morning decisions.

## Why This Formula Works
Protein keeps you full, fiber slows digestion, and healthy fat stabilizes energy. Together they prevent sharp blood sugar swings.

## 7-Day Plan
**Days 1–2:** Choose one go-to breakfast  
**Days 3–4:** Add a fruit or nuts  
**Days 5–7:** Swap in a new protein source
