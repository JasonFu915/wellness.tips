Walking is one of the most reliable ways to improve health, but many people struggle to make time for long workouts. The trick is to turn walking into tiny, repeatable moments across your day.

## Why Walking Works
Regular walking improves circulation, reduces stress, supports metabolism, and boosts mood. It is low impact and easy to maintain.

## Simple Cues That Add Steps
### 1) Walk after meals
Even 5–10 minutes after eating helps blood sugar and digestion.

### 2) Take calls on your feet
Standing or pacing during phone calls adds steps effortlessly.

### 3) Use “one more stop”
Get off one stop early or park a little farther away.

## Make It Stick
- Keep comfortable shoes near the door  
- Set a daily step target you can reach  
- Track a simple streak (no need for perfection)  

## 7-Day Plan
**Days 1–2:** Add a 5-minute walk after one meal  
**Days 3–4:** Walk during one phone call  
**Days 5–7:** Combine both and aim for 20 minutes total  

## Quick Tip
Listen to a favorite podcast only while walking to make it more enjoyable.

## Common Mistakes
- Doing one long walk and skipping the rest of the week  
- Waiting for perfect weather  
- Believing short walks “don’t count”  

## Upgrade Option
Once 20 minutes is easy, try intervals: walk fast for 1 minute, easy for 2 minutes, repeat.
