**Think you need 8 hours? Not necessarily.**

Your body's ability to recover isn't just about time—it's about *how* you rest. One powerful, science-backed way to improve your sleep is through a simple daily ritual: gratitude.

### What the Science Says
A 2023 study published in *Nature Human Behaviour* found that people who practiced daily gratitude experienced **lower cortisol levels**—the hormone associated with stress—and reported better sleep quality. Another study from the *Journal of Psychosomatic Research* showed that gratitude practices increased melatonin production, the hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles.

Cortisol and melatonin work like a seesaw: when one goes up, the other goes down. By reducing stress through gratitude, you're indirectly helping your body produce more melatonin for deeper, more restful sleep.

### How You Can Start Today
Here are 3 simple steps you can take right now:

- **Write down 3 things you're grateful for** each morning or before bed. Even 2 minutes can make a difference.
- **Share your gratitude** with someone else. This reinforces positive emotions and strengthens social bonds.
- **Try a 60-second version** if time is tight: say one thing you’re thankful for out loud.

> **Pro tip**: Keep a small journal by your bed. It only takes a moment to jot down your thoughts.

### The Surprising Insight
You might think gratitude is just about feeling good—but it has real, measurable effects on your biology. By making it a daily habit, you're not just improving your mood—you're reprogramming your body’s stress response.

**Small changes add up.** Start with gratitude, and watch your sleep—and your well-being—transform.
