## The Morning Myth
You might think you need hours of sleep to feel refreshed, but science shows that even small changes can have big impacts. Think you need 8 hours? Not necessarily.

## What Science Says
According to the Mayo Clinic, stretching in the morning helps improve flexibility, increase blood flow, and reduce stiffness. A study published in *Frontiers in Physiology* found that morning stretching can also help regulate your body's circadian rhythm, which affects how you feel throughout the day.

## 5 Easy Steps to Try Today
- **Take 5 minutes** after waking up to do a few gentle stretches.
- **Focus on your neck and shoulders**—they often hold tension from sleep.
- **Reach for the ceiling** to stretch your spine and arms.
- **Sit on the floor and bend forward** to loosen your lower back and hamstrings.
- **Breathe deeply** while stretching to enhance relaxation and oxygen flow.

> **Tip**: No time? Try this 60-second version: neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, and a seated forward fold.

## Surprising Insight
Did you know that stretching can actually help your body produce more melatonin, the hormone that helps you sleep better at night? It’s a simple way to support your natural rhythms.

## Empower Yourself Today
Small changes add up. Start with one stretch today and notice how your body feels. You don’t need a gym or special equipment—just a few minutes of movement can make all the difference.
