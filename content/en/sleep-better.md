If your mind stays busy at night, you are not alone. Many people feel tired but still struggle to fall asleep because the body has not received a clear signal that it is safe to rest. Sleep is not about forcing yourself to “try harder,” it is about creating the right conditions so your nervous system can downshift naturally.

This guide gives you a simple 10-minute routine you can repeat every night. It is designed to calm the body, reduce mental noise, and build a reliable sleep habit without pills.

## What to Do
### 1) Dim lights 60 minutes before bed
Bright light blocks melatonin, the hormone that makes you sleepy. Start by lowering lights one hour before bedtime.

- Turn off overhead lights and use a lamp  
- Switch your phone to night mode  
- Avoid intense work or emotionally charged content  

### 2) Do 4-7-8 breathing for 4 cycles
Slow breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system and reduces stress hormones.

**Steps:**
1. Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds  
2. Hold for 7 seconds  
3. Exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds  
4. Repeat 4 cycles  

If the timing feels too long, start with 3-5-6 and work up.

### 3) Keep the room cool and quiet
A slight drop in body temperature is a natural sleep signal.

- Aim for 18–20°C (64–68°F)  
- Use a lighter blanket  
- Keep the bedroom for sleep only  

## Why It Helps
- **Dim light** supports melatonin release and tells your brain it is nighttime  
- **Slow breathing** lowers heart rate and calms the stress response  
- **Cool temperature** helps the body enter deeper sleep stages  

## What to Do 30 Minutes Before Sleep
This window matters most. Choose one or two calming activities:

- Light stretching (neck, shoulders, lower back)  
- Reading a paper book for 10–15 minutes  
- Writing down tomorrow’s top 3 tasks  
- Listening to soft music or ambient sound  

Avoid news, social media, or intense video content.

## Common Questions
**Q: What if I still cannot sleep?**  
A: If you are awake for 20 minutes, get up and do something quiet in dim light. Return to bed when sleepy.

**Q: Does late exercise hurt sleep?**  
A: High-intensity workouts late at night can keep your heart rate elevated. Try to finish vigorous exercise at least 3–4 hours before bed.

## 7-Day Plan
**Days 1–2:** Only dim the lights  
**Days 3–4:** Add 4-7-8 breathing  
**Days 5–7:** Do all three steps consistently  

## Quick Tip
Leave your phone outside the bedroom to avoid dopamine spikes and late-night scrolling.
