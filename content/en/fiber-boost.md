Fiber supports digestion, gut health, and steady energy, but many people get far less than they need. The key is to increase fiber gradually and with enough water.

## Easy Fiber Swaps
- White rice → brown rice or quinoa  
- Regular bread → whole-grain bread  
- Chips → roasted nuts or popcorn  

## Add One Fiber-Rich Item Per Meal
Examples: berries at breakfast, beans at lunch, vegetables at dinner.

## Avoid Common Mistakes
- Adding too much fiber too fast  
- Skipping water  
- Relying only on supplements  

## 7-Day Plan
**Days 1–2:** Add one fruit per day  
**Days 3–4:** Add one serving of vegetables  
**Days 5–7:** Add beans or whole grains  

## Quick Tip
If you feel bloated, reduce the amount slightly and increase water.

## Why Fiber Matters
Fiber improves digestion, supports gut bacteria, and keeps you full longer. It also helps stabilize blood sugar.

## Easy Fiber Sources
- Beans and lentils  
- Oats and chia  
- Leafy greens  
- Apples or pears with the skin  

## Common Mistake
Adding too much fiber without water can cause discomfort. Increase slowly.
