**Think you need 8 hours? Not necessarily.** Many people struggle with overthinking at night, which can disrupt sleep and leave you feeling exhausted the next day. But science shows that **your mindset matters more than you think**—and there are simple, effective ways to take control.

### The Science Behind Overthinking
Research from the **Mayo Clinic** shows that overthinking activates the **amygdala**, the brain’s emotional center, making it harder to relax. Additionally, **low melatonin levels** (the hormone that helps you fall asleep) can worsen this cycle.

### 3 Practical Steps You Can Try Tonight
- **Write down your thoughts**: Spend 5 minutes jotting down what’s on your mind. This creates mental space and reduces the pressure to keep thinking about it.
- **Practice deep breathing**: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 6. Repeat 5 times. This activates your body’s **relaxation response**.
- **Set a ‘worry time’ earlier in the day**: Give yourself 15 minutes to think through problems before bed. This trains your brain to let go of them at night.

> **No time? Try this 60-second version:** Take three deep breaths, then write one thing you’re grateful for. It’s a quick reset.

### A Surprising Insight
You might think you need silence to sleep, but **white noise or soft music** can actually help your brain focus less on your thoughts and more on relaxation.

**Small changes add up!** Start with one step tonight and watch how your mind begins to quiet down. You don’t need a magic pill—just a little science and self-compassion.
