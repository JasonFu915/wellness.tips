Sitting for hours tightens the hips, compresses the spine, and strains the neck. The solution is not a perfect chair—it is small, frequent movement.

## The 2-Minute Reset
### 1) Neck release
Gently tilt your head to each side for 20 seconds.

### 2) Chest opener
Clasp your hands behind your back, lift slightly, and breathe for 20 seconds.

### 3) Hip stretch
Stand up, step one foot back, and stretch the front of the hip for 20 seconds per side.

## How Often?
Aim for once every 60–90 minutes. Set a reminder if needed.

## Desk Setup Basics
- Screen at eye level  
- Feet flat on the floor  
- Shoulders relaxed, not raised  

## Quick Tip
Take a phone call standing to break long sitting blocks.

## Why Short Breaks Matter
Small, frequent movement reduces stiffness better than a single long session.

## Optional Add-Ons
- Stand and reach overhead for 20 seconds  
- March in place for 30 seconds  
- Roll your shoulders slowly 10 times
